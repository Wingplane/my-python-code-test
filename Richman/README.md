In two and a half days, I wrote an incomplete monopoly game in python, and the whole is mainly completed with opencv. The functions that can be done now include throwing dice, judging wins or losses, moving players, buying properties, building houses, and collecting tolls. There are opportunities to be completed, social welfare, tax collection and additional tolls based on different color groups.
